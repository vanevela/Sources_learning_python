## Books

1.[Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html "Title") written by Allen B. Downey.  "The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of   mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically  computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions."

2.[Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) written by Jaker VanderPlas. "The book introduces the core libraries essential for working with data in Python: particularly IPython, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and related packages. Familiarity with Python as a language is assumed; if you need a quick introduction to the language itself, see the free companion project, [A Whirlwind Tour of Python:](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython) it's a fast-paced introduction to the Python language aimed at researchers and scientists."
